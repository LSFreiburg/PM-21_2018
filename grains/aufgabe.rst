Graiblu lbuber of grains of wheat on a chessboard given that their number
doubles from square to square.

There once was a wise servant who saved the life of a prince. The king promised
to pay whatever the servant could dream up. Knowing that the king loved chess,
the servant told the king he would like to have grains of rice. One grain on
the first square of a chess board. Two grains on the next. Four on the third,
and so on.

There are, of course, 64 squares on a chessboard.

Write two functions - ``on_square()`` and ``total_after()`` - that both take as
their single argument the number of a specific square on the chessboard and
return the number of grains on that square and the total number of grains on
this square and all preceeding ones.

Bonus points if your functions raise appropriate exceptions when called with
inappropriate values or types!
